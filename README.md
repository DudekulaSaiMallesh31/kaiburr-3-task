# Task-3

## Overview
Task-3 is a full-stack project that includes a frontend built with React and a backend that handles task creation, execution, and deletion. The project also integrates with Postman for API testing and validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm
- React
- Postman (for API testing)
- Backend setup (e.g., Express.js, MongoDB, or any other backend technology used)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DudekulaSaiMallesh31/kaiburr-2-task.git
   cd kaiburr-2-task
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

## API Testing with Postman
- Use Postman to test task creation, execution, and deletion.
- Ensure the backend is running before making API requests.

## Features
### 1. Task Management
- Create tasks via the frontend.
- View the list of tasks in both Postman and the frontend.
- Execute tasks from the frontend.
- Delete tasks after execution.
